# DAPI Connect Node

## Introduction

The DAPI Connect Node is a library that runs as part of your backend and handles communication between your backend and the Dapi API (<https://api.dapi.co>).

## Library Setup

This repo contains the source code of the library. To build the library, run the below script:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a folder called `lib` in the folder.

### Example app

I have included an example folder to make it wasy for any developer to play with this library. But since this example is in `ts`, you will have to compile the `ts` to `js` and then run the js output file. To do this run the below script

```sh
tsc ./example/Client.ts && node ./example/Client.js
```

> _Note:_ For the above script to work, you need to install `typescript` globally on your system.
>
> `sh npm install -g typescript `

## DAPI App
